        "15 commandments of sports betting for successful bettors",
        "Many bettors claim that there are no rules in betting, and that success depends on luck or chance. We fundamentally disagree with this position, because the key to successful betting lies precisely in a competent approach, which consists of a set of specific rules. These rules were developed on the basis of many years of experience of professional bettors who have achieved the highest heights in the world of betting and managed to make millions of fortunes. We will tell you about these rules in the article. And to adhere to them or not - the choice is yours.\n\nBasic rules of betting: for beginners and not only\n\nBuilding a successful career in betting, earning impressive capital, making winning bets - do you think this is all a myth? No, this is reality. Every player can make money on bets. It's all about the approach.\n\nYes, even spontaneous and volatile bets can occasionally turn out to be winning. But of course, there can be no question of any stable earnings with this approach. Because to build your betting strategy on the principles of \"lucky or unlucky\" is like building a house on the sand. Sooner or later it will \"float\" and fall apart. For successful betting and consistently high income, you need a strong (even reinforced concrete) foundation. And it consists of a competent approach and the right tools.\n\nRely on xG statistics\n\nThis is the first and most important rule. An immutable law of every professional bettor. In the post-Soviet space, only a few bettors know about xG statistics, but we are making a lot of efforts to fight this ignorance. Because in the countries of Western Europe and America, xG statistics and its data are very popular and in demand. After all, it is the most accurate and by far the most effective tool that allows you to find the most profitable bets on undervalued or overvalued events.\n\nThe use of xG statistics data allows the player to conduct an independent analysis of the match and choose the most profitable bet. The most successful bettors on the planet have made millions thanks to xG statistics. So you can too. To learn more about how to use xG statistics for betting, watch the video on our website.\n\nFind rates with a positive ROI\n\nWe keep repeating the importance of ROI for winning bets. This is no less significant factor than xG statistics, therefore it is an integral part of a powerful foundation for successful betting. The ROI indicator should become the main benchmark in rates. The search for rates by ROI allows you to build a successful strategy that will be effective and profitable over the long haul.\n\nWork with odds archive\n\nWhat are these archives for? In order to run the mathematical model developed by the bettor on them. After all, its profitability and effectiveness can only be determined over a long period. And this does not require 100, 200 or even 1000 matches.\n\nTo objectively assess how well the chosen strategy works, you need to analyze it for at least 10,000 matches. Better even more. Without the odds archive, this would have taken several years (if not a dozen). But there is absolutely no need to wait so long, because you can run the model through the matches already played and see the result.\n\nWhat is odds archive? This is an ordinary Excel database, which contains the results of the matches played and the odds that were given on them by the bookmaker's offices. The secret to the success of professional players lies in the fact that they use the odds archive to understand whether there is a plus in the chosen strategy or not. To learn more about the odds archive and see how they work with illustrative examples, be sure to watch the 8th issue of Triumph.\n\nObserve competent bankroll management\n\nBankroll management is often overlooked by bettors as not a very important factor. This is especially true for beginners who do not attach importance to this. Nevertheless, the skill of competent money management is a prerequisite for becoming a professional bettor. In addition, it is inextricably linked with the search for ROI and the archive of coefficients.\n\nHow do these three powerful tools work? Bettor searches the odds archive for his ROI. Next, it creates a variance generator, in which it creates 100 charts and marks the maximum drawdown. Looking at the results, the bettor chooses such a bankroll depth that can withstand any drawdown of the strategy. Even if it is just huge.\n\nRemember that for successful betting you need to set huge distances and be very patient - this is the only way you can pass the chart with large (and sometimes long) drawdowns and, as a result, get huge profits.\n\nAlways consider variance\n\nWithout dispersion, the betting world would collapse. Rather, it would not even have formed, because all the results could be accurately calculated in advance. In fact, everything is different. Therefore, there is such a phenomenon as dispersion. And since it exists, the bettor must take it into account.\n\nThe greater the betting distance, the more accurately you can determine the bettor's skill. Some players, by the way, can swing the variance, disrupting the clarity of the results by their erroneous actions. One of these is non-compliance with bankroll management. Meanwhile, variance should not be perceived as something 100% good or bad. You just need to come to terms with its existence, and treat its positive or negative turns calmly.\n\nHow to reduce the effect of variance on the result? Quite simply - stop rocking it with rash actions, observe competent bankroll management and abandon dubious strategies. Want to understand what variance is and how it affects your betting success? Then watch the 8th issue of the \"Triumph\" vlog.\n\nChoose the right bookmaker\n\nFootball betting rules start with a careful selection of the bookmaker's office. Why pay so much attention to this? In order to protect yourself from cutting the highs in the future, to secure your capital and not go bankrupt on too large a margin. We recommend choosing several bookmakers at once - this will allow you to find bets with the most favorable odds.\n\nAbout which office is better to choose, what to look for, who has what rules for sports betting - all this and a lot of other useful information about choosing a bookmaker, you will learn if you look at the 7th issue of the Triumfator vlog.\n\nIf you are afraid to make a mistake when choosing a bookmaker and do not know how to find the most reliable bookmakers, watch our 2 videos on Youtube dedicated to this topic: \"Why bet on sports in different bookmakers?\" and \"How to make money on bets if bookmakers cut the highs?\"\n\nDevelop your own betting model\n\n\"Why develop anything at all?\" - you ask. At the very least, so as not to drain your entire bankroll by placing bets at random. Professional successful bettors build their own forecasting models based on the mathematics of bets. Subsequently, it is this model that will predict the probabilities of match outcomes. Based on the probabilities obtained, you can search for rates with a positive ROI.\n\nThis is what the golden rules of betting look like. By following them, any gambler can reach the highest heights in rates and secure a stable high income."

        "General rules for successful betting: what else is important to consider?",
        "The above golden rules for sports betting relate mainly to the tools of a successful bettor. But there are a few more general rules related to betting tactics and behavior.\n\n- Do not make random bets. Betting at random and at random are ruinous. And this will happen much earlier than you imagine. Stable earnings can only be ensured by a constant strategy and strict adherence to the bankroll. Choose one of the existing strategies or develop your own, test its effectiveness and if it pays off, follow it steadily.\n\n- Don't bet on everything. It is simply impossible to understand all sports at the same high level. Do not bet on the first event you come across, even if you really want to. If you are the best at football, then bet on football, not hockey. It's better to focus on the quality of your analytics rather than the number of bids. All the more thoughtless.\n\n- Never recoup or go all-in. More often than not, the desire to recoup in any way turns into financial collapse. As well as the desire to bet all the money at a high coefficient. Professional bettors don't do that. Actually, that's why they manage to earn impressive capital. The rates should be thoughtful, as should their size. But with passion and the desire to take risks, you need to fight hard. After all, raising rates after defeats, you only increase the variance, and sooner or later this will lead you to financial ruin.\n\n- Never put under the influence of emotion. Remember that in the world of professional betting there is no place for emotions and worries. Bets should be made only on the basis of objective factors: xG statistics, ROI, variance. Also give up all favorites (teams and players) if you want to become a professional bettor. Otherwise, you will unconsciously give the advantage to your favorite team. And this is fraught with failure.\n\n- Take your time and effort to learn betting. Only hard work, desire to improve and constant work on yourself will allow you to become a professional bettor. In addition, the world of betting is constantly evolving, new tools appear (for example, xG statistics), tactics and approaches. Those who constantly learn and develop, as a result, find themselves one step (or even two) ahead of the pool of players. "

        "How to learn how to bet on sports?",
        "The first question that newcomers to betting ask themselves is: \"How to learn to bet on sports?\" After all, for a person who is just starting to get acquainted with betting, the world of betting often seems incomprehensible, confusing and frighteningly huge. How not to panic, figure out everything and start making money by making the most profitable bets - we will tell about all this in the article. Read on and learn how to make money on bets - it's not as difficult as it sounds.\n\nWhat prevents beginners from making money on bets?\n\nBefore we start learning how to make money on bets, let's see what factors and mistakes usually prevent novice players from making money on bets. Spoiler alert: In the hope of making easy money, newbies often get caught up in all sorts of divorces and lose their money. Let's take a closer look at the most common obstacles on the path of a beginner to successful bets.\n\n- Fixed games. This is perhaps one of the most common misconceptions in the betting world. And if professional players have enough knowledge and experience to immediately dismiss the agreements, then the newcomers are going with a bang. Of course, to deny the existence of match fixing is simply stupid. They are. But information about the final score of these events is owned by a very narrow circle of people, or rather, only three people: the customer, the organizer and the performer, that is, the athlete. Believe me, none of these people will share information about the results of a future match on the pages of sports forums. Anyway, anywhere. Therefore, remember: if you are offered a sure bet (and even at a bargain price) - in front of you is definitely a fraud. By the way, such scammers often give different accounts to different players, and in the end they guess in some of the options. But this has nothing to do with real awareness of the results of the fixing match.\n\n- Try to determine the winner. One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is trying to determine the winner of a match. And for successful betting, in fact, you need to determine the probabilities of various outcomes and choose a profitable odds with a positive ROI. For example, in the Barcelona - Juventus match, the odds on the outcomes are as follows: 1.77 - Barcelona win, 3.64 - draw and 5.55 - Juventus win. If we translate these odds into probabilities, we get 56.49% - Barcelona win, 27.47% - draw, 18.01% - Juventus win. And if your model in bets shows that Juventus will win about 20-22% of the time, then a bet on Juventus to win at 5.55 odds is a bet with a positive ROI and it doesn't matter how the match ends. If you are confident that your strategy really works, even if Barcelona win 5-0, your bet was still correct. Why is that? Yes, because you set according to your working strategy, which means that, having covered a huge distance, you will eventually come out into a solid plus. This is a very important nuance that newbies (as a rule) do not understand.\n\n- Place bets on catch-up. A typical mistake of almost every non-professional player (especially beginners) is trying to recoup after a loss. When a gambler is annoyed that the bet has been lost, he tries to immediately \"recoup\" his money by doubling the bet. As a rule, this does not end well. The result is almost always complete financial ruin and ruin. Moreover, on dogons, the bankroll is drained very quickly. After all, the catch-up strategy does not bring any increase in ROI, but only gives a huge swing to the variance. The challenge for every successful bettor is to look for bets with a positive ROI and adhere to the correct bankroll management. It is important for beginners to understand this and immediately give up the idea of ​​winning back, fighting this desire with all their might.\n\n- Make bets based on value judgment after watching matches. This is a very common mistake for beginners and all gamblers. Remember that watching matches and knowing how the teams play is practically nothing in terms of professional betting. Because if you don't know the basics of betting, work with a database and build models in Excel, you will never reach the next level.\n\n- Buy paid strategies. Many betting \"specialists\" suggest inexperienced players to buy winning strategies. And in order to convince beginners of the necessity and effectiveness of such an investment, scammers usually show screenshots of winning multi bets and withdrawing large sums from the bookmaker's office. It is quite possible that some of the proposed strategies will help a newbie go at least to zero, but sooner or later it will end anyway, and it will fail. Therefore, do not waste time and money looking for and buying a \"magic pill\". Remember that only a competent approach, the right tools and the development of your own betting model can lead to success in betting.\n\n- Ignore the importance of distance in betting. Many beginners do not even suspect that 1, 2, 10, 50 and even 100 bets are absolutely not an indicator in the world of professional betting. Real professionals make thousands\n\n- Learn to choose bets with a minimum margin. Don't worry if you don't know how to do this yet - this skill comes with experience. But we will show you a few tricks that will help you not to lose money on margin overpayment. First, bet mainly on handicaps and totals, because the margins on these types of bets are usually the lowest. Second, for now, refrain from betting on the first team to win, the second team to win and a draw. A wide list and bets like “both will score” are also not your option, because they are offered by unreliable offices (well, as a rule).\n\n- Learn to choose a reliable office. There are a huge number of bookmakers today. It is clear that it is difficult for a beginner to immediately choose a reliable bookmaker. Therefore, heed our advice: there are only two best offices in the world - they are Pinnacle and SBOBET. Why you should opt for them and what to look for when choosing a bookmaker's office, find out in the 7th issue of the Triumfator vlog.\n\n- Learn how to properly manage your bankroll. Professional bettors do not place bets at random, much less determine the amount. The bet size should be calculated so that your bankroll can withstand even the deepest drawdown. To do this, the player must find his ROI from the coefficient archive and create a variance generator that will show the maximum drawdown on the charts. Based on the results obtained, the correct bankroll is selected. To find out all the subtleties, tricks and nuances of bankroll management and its distribution in sports betting, see Issue 3 of the Triumfator vlog. "

        "Europa League matches 2019/2020. How to bet?\n\nHow to bet on the Europa League with xG? Bettorov worries about the answer to this question, because statistics from the xScore website are collected only for domestic championships. In this article, we will try to find options for profitable bets on Europa League matches in the same way as we did the Champions League bets. Let's try to find live ROI using xG statistics.\n\nEuropa League betting according to xG statistics\n\nIn order to bet on the Europa League, we need to choose a suitable match. To do this, you need to find a pair of opponents in which one team starts to play worse with a change in the score, and the other one is better. How can you tell if a team is starting to play better or worse? We will focus on the xG / xGA score for a tie and for a different score, tracking how the scores change relative to a tied score. One team has to improve its performance relative to a draw, while the other has to worsen the opposite performance, it's very simple. For example, if one team starts to play better when it loses in the score, and the other, on the contrary, starts to play worse when it wins, then this is our situation.\n\nNext, the bettor needs to wait in live for a suitable situation and bet on the team whose results become better with a change in the score, that is, with a change in the score, the team improves its performance. It is quite possible to find a high ROI at such a rate. The fact is that a large part of the pool of players bets on the basis of traditional statistics, which will not give them all the information about the strength of the teams. Due to this factor, the coefficient will be incorrect. So let's try to find suitable commands to bet on.\n\nEuropa League: features of betting according to xG statistics\n\nWhen betting on this strategy, do not forget that the championships began not so long ago, and the teams have not yet played enough distance for the most accurate results. Also, do not forget about the variance: remember that the bettor needs to play up the distance, especially in live. You will not know the exact ROI using this strategy, but in this way it is quite possible to make a profitable bet, since the pool of players does not have this information."

        "We bet on the Champions League using xG statistics",
        "Champions League group stage matches 2019/2020. What to bet on?\n\nMany users are looking for an answer to the question: how to bet on the Champions League? Since the xG statistics on the xScore website are only available for domestic championships, bettors are deprived of an important betting tool. But there is one way that can help you find live ROI using xG statistics even in European competitions. Although it is not entirely correct to compare the xG statistics of the domestic championships, there is one sure way. What do you need to do for this?\n\nBetting on the Champions League with xG statistics\n\nFor betting on the Champions League, you need to find a pair of opponents where one team, with a change in the score, starts playing either much better or much worse, and the second team, when the score changes, behaves in the opposite way. For example, one team, starting to win, improves the xG performance relative to the indicators in a draw, which means that the other team should have poor performance when losing in the account, relative to their own indicators in a draw.\n\nAll that a bettor needs to do is to wait for a suitable situation in live and boldly bet on that team from a pair, whose results improve with a change in the score. In most cases, the ROI on such a bet will be outrageous, since traditional statistics will not give players such comprehensive information. The overwhelming majority of the pool of players who are guided only by traditional statistics do not own these data, which means that the coefficient will be incorrect.\n\nXG statistics betting: what are the features?\n\nWhat should be remembered when placing bets using this strategy? The fact is that the championships began not so long ago, and the teams simply have not yet played enough distance for the results to be as accurate as possible. Be aware of the variance factor as well. One bet is not an indicator, especially in live, where the variance is especially high. Play a sufficient distance. "

        "More bets on total. Determine probability based on xG and strength rating",
        "Why is it so much more pleasant and interesting to bet on total more than on total less? This happens for several reasons. Firstly, goals can be scored at the very beginning of the match, and your bet will go through in the very first minutes. In the case of a bet on total less, you have to worry about the whole match so that no one scores. The second reason is the process of the match itself. It is much more pleasant to root for total in football, because everyone loves to watch spectacular and eventful matches. Sports betting can be done in many ways, but not all of them work. Let's look at one of the working strategies for finding a profitable total over bet.\n\nHow do amateurs bet on total more?\n\nMost people in the street calculate the probability of total in primitive ways. The easiest way is to count the goals scored in a match, that is, to compare the average number of goals in each match for both teams over the last five matches. It's a little more difficult to count how many times a team has broken TB 2.5 and TM 2.5 in the last 5 matches, and then compare this number. An even deeper way is to divide matches into home and away matches. The problem lies in the fact that all these methods do not in any way take into account the level of protection of the teams and the quality of these teams, which means that it is negative to make bets on football based on such information at a distance.\n\nLet's try to conduct an in-depth analysis of the match using the detailed information for the total over bet.\n\nFootball Betting: Should the Championship Be Judged?\n\nFirst, let's learn how to assess the quality of the championship. How to do it? It's simple, for this we add up all the goals scored during the championship for the home team and divide by the number of matches. We do the same for the guest team. Let's take the Swedish championship and evaluate the quality of this championship.\n\nLet's count the number of all goals for the home team - 261, the number of matches played - 168, then a simple operation:\n\n261/168 = 1.55\n\nThe home team scores 1.55 goals per game on average.\n\nLet's count the number of all goals for the visiting team - 188, the number of matches played - 168, calculate the indicator:\n\n188/168 = 1.12.\n\nIn one match in the Swedish championship, the away team scores an average of 1.12 goals.\n\nTotal more strategy: why are team skills needed?\n\nNext, we define the skills of the teams. Take the Hecken vs. Falkenberg match as an example. In 10 home matches, Hecken scored 18 goals, that is, 1.8 goals per match on average. The team conceded 6 goals in 10 games, on average 0.6 goals conceded per match.\n\nWhat do we see at Falkenberg? Away, the team scored 10 goals in 10 matches, on average one goal per match. Falkenberg conceded 29 goals in 10 matches, that is, 2.9 goals per match.\n\nCalculating the strength rating of football teams to bet on total\n\nNow let's try to calculate the strength rating of the teams. To begin with, let's stipulate that for a good attack, the power rating must be> 1, and for a good defense, <1.\n\nHecken's average number of goals is 1.8. Divide by 1.55 (league average goal score for hosts): 1.8 / 1.55 = 1.16. We can see that the team's attack strength rating is clearly above average. In the same way, we calculate the defense: 0.6 / 1.12 (average goals for the league for guests), we get 0.54, which is an excellent indicator.\n\nLet's carry out similar calculations for Falkenberg. Attack power rating: 1 / 1.12 = 0.89, defense rating 2.9 / 1.55 = 1.88. Here the opposite situation is developing, the team's performance leaves much to be desired, especially defense.\n\nCalculation of team strength for profitable bets\n\nIt remains to calculate the strength of the teams, taking into account both attack and defense. Let's multiply the team's attack strength rating by the opponent's defense strength rating, and then multiply by the average goals in the league.\n\n- Expected number of goals from the home team: 1.16 * 1.88 * 1.55 = 3.38.\n- Expected number of goals from the away team: 0.89 * 0.54 * 1.12 = 0.54.\n\nNow you just need to add these numbers to find out the total in the match: 3.38 + 0.54 = 3.92. We get a total of four.\n\nWhich Betting Ratio Should I Choose?\n\nThe odds for this match were as follows:\n\n- Total over (3.5) - 2.18\n- Total over (3) - 1.74\n\nThe match ended up 4-1, and our bet won with a good odds.\n\nHow to bet on sports wisely? Qualitative analysis of the match\n\nTo minimize the margin of error due to the teams' luck in previous matches, we must use xG statistics. To do this, let's add columns “xG90” and “xGA / 90” to the calculation, from which you can understand how many chances a team creates and allows to create in 90 minutes, that is, in one match.\n\nLet's calculate the average xG90 for home teams, for this we add all the indicators, and then divide them by the number of teams, that is, by 16. The average is 1.32 xG. As you remember, the average of the home teams' real goals is 1.55. Now we calculate the average xGA90, we get 1.09 xGA, which is very close to real goals - 1.12.\n\nHome team xG strength rating calculation:\n\n- Hecken's team attack: 1.56 / 1.32 = 1.18.\n- Hecken's team defense: 0.99 / 1.09 = 0.91.\n\nJudging by the goals scored, Hecken's defense rating was 0.54, but in fact, Hecken's defense rating was 0.91. As it turned out, this indicator was so good only due to the luck of the teams at their gates. We can check this in the same table. The goal conceded rate, GA, is 6 goals. The xGA score, that is, the expected goals conceded, is 10.4. We see that the team is lucky, it should have conceded 4 more goals.\n\nCalculating the xG rating of the visiting team:\n\n- Falkenberg Attack: 1.28 / 1.09 = 1.17.\n- Falkenberg Defense: 1.91 / 1.32 = 1.45.\n\nCalculation of expected goals for the upcoming match:\n\n- Team Hecken quality: 1.18 (attack) * 1.45 (Falkenberg defense) * 1.32 (league average) = 2.26.\n- Team quality Falkenberg: 1.17 (attack) * 0.91 (Hecken defense) * 1.09 (league average) = 1.16.\n\nWe can only add these indicators: 2.26 + 1.16 = 3.42.\n\nBased on these calculations, total 4 does not seem so obvious anymore, but total over 3 is still worth taking.\n\nWe make our own detailed prediction for the match\n\nTo get even more information, let's check and compare how these teams played against opponents who had similar playing parameters. To do this, let's move on to the next table, from which we can see how the teams played at different moments of the match: with an equal score, with a draw, lagging behind or taking the lead. For total, the indicator in a draw game is more important.\n\nThe team with the most similar stats is Sirius. Let's take a look at the Hecken vs Sirius match and see how it went. Hecken beat Sirius 4-1, as in the Hecken-Falkenberg match.\n\nNow we will select an opponent for Falkenberg, Norrkoping is perfect for this role. The Norrkoping - Falkenberg match ended 4-3.\n\nBased on these results, it becomes obvious that total over 3 is a great bet.\n\nPoisson Distribution: Mathematics in Sports Betting\n\nLet's look at another way to calculate the probability of total - using the Poisson distribution.\n\nThis is a probability distribution that can be classified as discrete. It models a random variable as the number of events that happened in a fixed time. These events occur with a certain and fixed average intensity, and independently of each other.\n\nUsing the Poisson distribution in sports betting, we need to calculate the probability that the home team will score one goal, then two, and so on. After five, the probabilities are already too low. The same needs to be done for the visiting team.\n\nFor this we use the formula “POISSON.DIST”. Insert the previously obtained values ​​into the “Goals” line, and then everything is calculated automatically. By adding the probabilities for scores 0-0, 1-0, 0-1, 1-1, 2-0 and 0-2, we get the probability TM (2.5). Subtract from the 100% probability the probability of TM (2.5), we get the probability of TB (2.5). By adding scores such as 2-1, 1-2, 3-0, and 0-3, we get the TM probability (3.5). Subtracting it from 100%, we get the probability of TB (3.5). Well, these probabilities will already help us find a positive ROI.\n\nThe odds for the match Hecken - Falkenberg were as follows:\n\n- TB (2.5) - 1.57\n- TB (3.5) - 2.51\n\nNow let's look at a table with these coefficients. A positive ROI on the Pinnacle opening line could be found for both TB (2.5) 4.26% and TB (3.5) 11.95%.\n\nBut on the closing line, the odds sagged significantly:\n\n- TB (2.5) - 1.47\n- TB (3.5) - 2.18.\n\nConsider the probabilities for these coefficients. We see that there is no positive ROI in these coefficients, a load has occurred, and there is no longer any point in betting on these coefficients. By changing the odds in Excel, you can find the minimum bet odds that can be profitable.\n\nProfitable sports betting: how do successful bettors bet?\n\nAs you can see, to find a profitable bet, we needed:xG statistics;\n\nExcel tables with archives of coefficients;\n\nROI indicator for rates.\n\nxG statistics will help you assess the real strength of the teams, the potential of the team and its real ability to score goals. This information will help you choose an individual total.\n\nThe ROI calculation is needed in order to understand how effective and profitable your bet will be, so that you can bet with a positive mathematical expectation. Well, by connecting Excel spreadsheets with an archive of odds to the work, you can test your betting model and understand how effective and profitable it is."

        "Losses in bets VS Sports betting no losses",
        "Losing bets: what to do and how to survive?\n\nEvery bet the bettor makes has the risk of losing. The degree of riskiness of the bet may be different, but it is in any case. And if one loss in a series of successful bets is quite easy to survive (subject to minimal financial losses, of course), then when a losing streak comes, it is psychologically much more difficult to cope. But nothing is impossible. Just follow our advice on what to do in case of a prolonged loss, so that you do not have a desire to abandon bets forever.\n\n#1. To have a break\n\nThe most dangerous time for a bettor is the first few minutes after losing a bet. Because it is at this time that most players have a great desire to win back and make a bet at random, just to get their money back. But after some time, this impulse begins to weaken, and then completely recedes. In no case should such bets be placed, because they are made under the influence of emotions, therefore they rarely win. When she also loses, you will want to win back again. This is a vicious circle from which it is very difficult to get out. Therefore, it is better not even to get involved in such adventures and take the loss calmly.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to win back your money - it is a natural human reaction to failure. The difference between a professional bettor and an amateur is that the former keeps their emotions under control, while the latter follows their lead. If you want to become a pro - keep calm, be patient and follow the cold calculation of bets in your strategy.\n\n# 2. Change your strategy\n\nIf you see that your strategy is failing, do not persist, but rather improve it. Changing your betting model will most likely benefit your betting tactics. But it's better to check the betting model in advance. How to do it?\n\nUse Excel tables with coefficient archives. You can run the developed betting model on already completed sporting events to check its effectiveness.\n\nThis will help minimize the number of losses on real bets. To learn all the subtleties of working with Excel tables and the archive of coefficients, see the 8th issue of the \"Triumphant\" vlog - we show how this is done with illustrative examples.\n\n# 3. Reduce your bet amount\n\nThis technique, of course, will not save you the risk of losing, but it will help reduce costs. This is especially important for bettors who cannot treat losses impartially and lose confidence with each loss. Although in fact, most bettors do exactly the opposite - they increase the size of the bet in order to win back as quickly as possible. It’s even hard to imagine how many people are losing bets by making this mistake.\n\nResist the urge to recoup by increasing the bet amount - this always leads to financial ruin.\n\nAt the initial stage, it is much more important for a novice bettor to understand that his strategy is working, rather than trying to win as much as possible by betting huge amounts. You will always have time to come to big money if your strategy is really working.\n\n#4. Place your bets carefully\n\nFocus on sports and leagues that you are well versed in. Don't bet randomly, influenced by emotions, fleeting desires and intuition. Intuition, of course, is good, but professional bettors still rely on their own mathematical model of bets, and not on an inner voice.\n\nThe main thing that will help you survive a series of failures is the realization that your long-distance strategy will still give you a plus. How to be sure of the long-term profitability of the strategy? Calculate ROI for each bet. If ROI is positive, then your strategy will be profitable in the distance. What is ROI in rates and how to calculate it, we tell in this video.\n\nMillions of people bet on sports every day, and losing is not uncommon here. Indeed, in betting, a person plays against a pool of players, who bet the outcome opposite to his bet. Therefore, if one side wins, the other is defeated. How much to win (and, accordingly, how much to lose), the bettor chooses independently. Most are limited to quite reasonable amounts, but sometimes real epic failures happen. Here are our top betting losses:\n\n- The player who fiercely supported the Spanish Barcelona put 35 thousand pounds on the victory of his favorite team with the odds of 1.07. The odds for the victory of the second team (Real Sociedad) were 8.1. Barcelona lost, and with it this would-be fan.\n\n- A fan from Russia made a bet on the favorite (with a handicap of +1.5) in the amount of 66 thousand dollars. As a result, this favorite conceded 4 goals and lost by a monstrous margin.\n\n- A student from Great Britain made a multiplier of 14 events, and each of them played. As a result, the guy won over $ 1 million. But he never got the win, because when he came to pick it up, it turned out that he made a bet on another coupon - one additional condition was not met, namely the mandatory goals of the teams.\n\n- In 2001, the player made a bet, the amount of which was equal to the value of his house. It was an English Premier League match between Tottenham and Manchester United. He bet on Tottenham to win ahead of the second half when the score was 3-0 in her favor. As a result, the team lost 3: 5, and the fan lost his home in less than an hour.\n\n- During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, a German fan bet € 500,000 for his country's national team to reach the final. He was so sure of this outcome. As you know, the Spanish national team beat the German national team, and the bet of half a million euros lost because of one single goal scored.\n\nSports betting without losing: myth or reality?\n\nMost gamblers try to find the perfect formula for how to bet without losing. But in fact, they are looking in the wrong plane. The thing is that bets without losing are a fairy tale, and to believe in them is stupidity. After all, you and I remember the experiment with a coin - the chance that heads or tails will come up 50/50. And it is simply impossible to completely exclude one of the probabilities, so there is always a risk of loss.\n\nOne should not look for a magic pill for losses, but try to minimize their risk. Then you can always be in the black.\n\nHow can this be achieved? You need a competent approach and the ability to use the correct tools of professional bettors.\n\nWe will not tire of repeating: check your strategy only over a long distance (no less than 10 thousand bets). This is the only way you can assess the real profitability of the chosen strategy.\n\nAlso, you must learn how to competently manage your capital, as the best bettors on the planet do. For this you need:\n\nfind your positive ROI by the archive of coefficients;\n\ncreate a variance generator with 100 charts that will show the maximum drawdown of the bankroll;\n\nchoose a bankroll deep enough to withstand even the largest drawdowns of the strategy.\n\nDon't try to bet on sports without losing. Better to put down huge distances, be patient and learn how to correctly manage your bankroll. This is the only way you can overcome even the most difficult charts, achieve success in betting and get huge profits as a result (and even double your bankroll).\n\nIf your strategy is developed on the basis of xG statistics data and has been tested over a long distance (using the odds archive), you can be sure that it will bring you profit. Of course, when a losing streak comes, the first (and most dangerous) thought is: the strategy is not working, you need to change it. But you must believe in its reliability and continue to place your bets.\n\nTo minimize the risk of financial collapse due to common bad luck, you need to initially build a strategy based on a high ROI. This is exactly what professional bettors do, who were able to make fortunes on bets."

        "Flat in betting: advantages, disadvantages, strategy features",
        "What is flat in sports betting?\n\nAs a financial strategy, flat is quite popular among bettors. This is partly due to its relative ease of use. To some players, flat is also known as \"fixed interest rate\", which fully reflects its essence.\n\nBy the way, we often come across one common misconception among bettors. It lies in the fact that many believe that flat is a betting strategy (you can easily find examples of this delusion on almost every website on the Russian Internet). In fact, flat is not a game, but a financial strategy. In other words, a bank management strategy.\n\nFlat strategy in sports betting: the basic principle\n\nAs a betting system, flat is used to determine not who to bet on, but how much. This is its peculiarity.\n\nThe principle of the flat strategy is to set a fixed percentage of your bankroll. It looks like this: at the very beginning, the bettor selects a certain amount of bets and does not change it for a long time. It turns out that flat is the rate multiplied by the percentage. Therefore, it does not depend on the real amount of the bankroll, but on its percentage. All this makes flat betting a strategy with minimal risks. Provided, of course, that the bettor knows all the subtleties of this system and knows how to build betting models.\n\nPros and cons of the flat strategy\n\nLike any other sports betting strategy, flat has both advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe clear pluses of this betting system include:\n\n- quite low (compared to other strategies) risks of losing the entire bankroll;\n- clear and simple strategy;\n- the ability to get more or less stable profit if you choose the maximum passable rates;\n- the ability to combine with other gaming strategies.\n\nAmong the disadvantages are the following factors:\n\n- the obligatory presence of an impressive initial capital;\n- a slow increase in the bankroll - when using a safe interest (from 0.5 to 2 of the total capital);\n- the need to strictly follow the rules and main principles of the strategy.\n\nMany players, especially beginners, believe in the win-win and absolute safety of this system. But the wonders of the flat betting strategy lie not in luck, but in a thoughtful approach and careful analysis of rates.\n\nFirst, you need to be able to analyze sports events. Because if your bets are negative, then the strategy is unlikely to bring you profit. Secondly, significant enrichment is almost impossible with a small bank. Therefore, players often start playing at higher bet percentages. But this is an extremely risky step and has nothing to do with professional betting.\n\nDespite the fact that flat is quite simple to understand and is often recommended for use by beginners, only experienced bettors achieve permanent profit. Obviously, this is due to the fact that professionals are able to competently analyze sports events and use the right tools for this. Because guessing alone will not go far, even if you use dynamic flat in your bets.\n\nAs we said above, the flat system works effectively over a long distance, making a profit, only if the bettor uses a well-constructed betting model.\n\nHow to build such a model?\n\nTo build the most accurate and efficient betting model, you first need to understand the type of data that will become the basis for further forecasting.\n\nFor example, the database is the fastest to collect in basketball due to the high number of points scored during a match. The tennis model should be based primarily on the player's shape, as this is a single player game. It is important here to build a model that can determine the probabilities of each number of games.\n\nIn football, goals already scored are the starting point. However, this approach is imprecise due to the high variance in this sport. For this, xG was developed. XG Match Statistics is a much more accurate tool for determining the winner of a match than any other and developing your own betting model. It is on the basis of xG statistics that all successful bettors build their betting models and thus earn impressive capitals.\n\nTo build an efficient betting model, with the help of which the player can then make profitable flat bets, it is necessary to develop an xG football match model using a Monte Carlo generator. It is important to keep in mind that the result of one match will be random. Therefore, you need to create a chain of matches and evaluate the probabilities for each outcome over a long distance."

        "Flat sports betting: what to bet on to win?",
        "With a competent approach, in principle, it does not matter what you bet on. After all, understanding the basics of professional betting and striving for independent analytics of sports events inevitably lead to the fact that you make the right choice in favor of winning bets. But what these basics are and how to learn how to choose safe bets yourself is another question.\n\nFirst of all, it is important for you to understand that no betting system can work for you better than your own strategy. Thoroughly thought out, experienced and personally tested. Therefore, it is so important to find your own approach, and not blindly follow other people's strategies.\n\nThe second step you need to take is to decide on the sport. Pick one and study it thoroughly. Then it will be much easier for you to understand the potential of teams, their style of play, behavior and reactions to different events. And since unforeseen circumstances (good and bad) happen all the time in sports, it is important to understand how the team will behave in new conditions. Will give up or fight. Will go on the defensive or start attacking. This information is shown by our xG statistics tables on the site. Using this data, you can find out how a team behaves at different scores and even at different intervals. These xG statistics allow you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of teams and make a profitable bet.\n\nThe third condition is to improve your psychology and get rid of favorite teams and fear of losing. Your task is to become an absolutely impartial professional capable of objectively assessing the sport as a whole and each team individually. Otherwise, sympathy for pets can give rise to unjustified hopes. And you cannot build a successful strategy on hopes - you need to rely on facts and statistics.\n\nThe fourth condition - choose bookmakers with the best betting conditions and optimal odds, and feel free to get down to business. How to choose a bookmaker's office, what to look for and which offices are generally considered the best, we tell you in the 7th issue of the Triumfator vlog. Be sure to check it out if you want to know all the secrets of choosing a bookmaker.\n\nThe fifth and most important condition is to use xG statistics and ROI for sports analytics. Just take it, figure it out once, learn it and start using it. At the same time, it is important not to forget to abandon all \"fake\" strategies, forecasts and other squabbles. Remember: only using the tools of a professional bettor can make you one. Maybe even better. You need to master only 4 tools:\n\n- xG statistics data;\n- ROI indicators;\n- Monte Carlo generator;\n- Excel tables with archives of coefficients."

        "How to have consistent winnings on bets: 3 powerful tools",
        "No matter what the \"experts\" in the theory of betting, who are a dime a dozen on the Internet, a stable win on bets is possible and completely real. We know this from our own experience. In fact, every bettor, even if he is still quite a beginner, can secure himself a stable win on sports betting. To do this, you just need to choose the right direction of the path in betting.\n\nLet's make a reservation right away: if you choose stability and successful career development, you will have to forget about agreements, forecasts and other unreliable nonsense forever. In the same way, you will have to forget about betting under the influence of emotions, because \"it seems\" or \"you want\", betting on favorites and the desire to win back your bet. All this does not lead to anything good. Moreover, these are deliberately failed decisions that only lead to ruin and drain the entire bankroll. Then how to consistently win on bets?\n\nIn fact, you only need:\n\n1. To smooth out the variance by “driving away” huge betting distances.\n2. Look for rates with a positive ROI.\n3. Use xG statistics.\n\nAnd now that the \"secret\" set of a successful bettor has been revealed, let's explain the benefits and effectiveness of each tool.\n\nDispersion and stability of winnings\n\nWhen talking about stability and winnings in long-distance betting, you should always remember about variance. Why is it so important? Because it is impossible to consistently win by making only 50 bets per month - the variance will be simply huge.\n\nVariance in sports betting is the deviation of match results from the average mathematically expected. In this case, deviations can be both positive and negative. Quiet periods can also occur over long distances. In fact, betting did not exist without variance, because without these deviations, the result of each game could be calculated in advance.\n\nIn fact, the winning streak can happen not because the bettor is a professional, but simply because of luck. Therefore, only long-term results can show the true professionalism of the player. By the way, you can swing the variance. To do this, it is enough just to commit erroneous actions, for example, to be negligent in managing your bankroll. In order for the variance to have a minimal impact on the result, you need to follow the correct bankroll management and refuse to use strategies that have not been proven to be effective.\n\nWhy do you need to place a lot of bets?\n\nBecause at a short distance, even a minus player can show positive statistics. Such a scammer, by the way, is actively used by scammers. They show a plus at short distances and lure money from gullible and not prudent bettors. As a rule, beginners and those who have never heard of dispersion and distance have taken a bite at this.\n\nOn short distances it is impossible to check the effectiveness of the developed betting model and the correctness of the chosen strategy. After all, the variance increases in inverse proportion to the number of bets. Accordingly, the more bets there are at the distance, the smaller the variance and the more accurate the result will be. Therefore, 50, 100, 500 and even 1000 bets are not an indicator.\n\nAny strategy that the bettor has developed independently must pass 10,000 bets. And that's at least. Only this distance allows us to see the real effectiveness of the strategy.\n\nYou can learn more about variance and clearly see how it works in the 8th issue of the Triumphant vlog. This issue covers all the intricacies and nuances of variance - be sure to watch it if you want to secure yourself a stable income on long-distance betting.\n\nRates with positive ROI\n\nWhat do most bettors focus on when choosing bets? For predictions, excitement, favorite players and anything else. Whereas the only reference point should be ROI, because only it is the most reliable reference point in betting.\n\nWhy then do bettors stubbornly ignore ROI? Because this tool seems too complicated or just unnecessary, which also requires additional time. And who wants to spend their energy on some kind of analytics, if you can buy a forecast or just put on your favorite team. So it turns out that instead of using the right tool to provide a stable income from sports betting, most simply drain their entire bankroll into nowhere.\n\nIn betting, ROI allows you to determine the profitability of a bet over a long distance and evaluate the effectiveness of forecasts.\n\nIt often happens that when the bets are passed, the player still remains at a loss. This is due to the fact that he did not use ROI metrics to calculate each bet. Bettors who use ROI metrics can see how much money has been invested and received. Therefore, they can visually assess the effectiveness of their game.\n\nRemember that a very good ROI is considered to be 5-7% - this is the result of the best bettors. This ROI will help you easily ride out a period of failure and win well during periods of success.\n\nYou can learn more about the correct approach to predicting matches using the ROI indicator in our video.\n\nxG statistics - 100% increase in the probability of a stable win on bets\n\nUsing xG statistics data, you will stop asking the question: \"Is it possible to win a stable bet?\" Because you will see what is possible. This is the most important, necessary and effective tool that exists in betting today. Why is xG statistics so good?\n\n- xG data allows the bettor to independently assess (deeply and with maximum objectivity) the potential of an entire team or one player. At the same time, for the analysis, the real indicators of the team for the game are used, and not the player's personal value judgment based on a subjective understanding of football.\n\n- xG statistics show the real strength of the teams. Analytics of xG table data allows the bettor to find overvalued and undervalued teams in order to subsequently use this information to find bets with the most profitable odds.\n\n- Thanks to xG statistics, the player can evaluate the play of teams and its performance in case of winning and losing scores. And it also helps you find the best rates.\n\nWhy are traditional statistics (on goals scored, ball possession and number of shots on goal) no longer sufficient for professional betting? First of all, because such statistics have long been outdated and have become irrelevant. In the world of professional betting, advanced xG statistics are actively used.\n\nYou can also use it if your goal is a high and stable income from bets. With this data, you can always be one step ahead of the pool of players, winning on bets.\n\nxG statistics are so effective that even football clubs use them to comprehensively analyze the team's play and determine its potential. And also sports media for the most accurate analysis of football matches."
